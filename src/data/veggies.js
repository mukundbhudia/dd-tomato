        content: `Tomatoes are now eaten freely throughout the world. They contain the
        carotene ​ lycopene​ , one of the most powerful natural ​
        antioxidants​ . In some studies, lycopene, especially in cooked
        tomatoes, has been found to help prevent ​ prostate cancer​ , ​
        [36]​ but other research contradicts this claim.​ [37] Lycopene has
        also been shown to improve the skin's ability to protect against
        harmful UV rays.​ [38]​ A study done by researchers at Manchester
        and Newcastle universities revealed that tomato can protect against
        sunburn and help keeping the skin looking youthful.​ [39]​ Natural
        genetic variation in tomatoes and their wild relatives has given a
        genetic plethora of genes that produce lycopene, carotene,
        anthocyanin, and other antioxidants. Tomato varieties are available
        with double the normal ​ vitamin C​ (Doublerich), 40 times normal ​
        vitamin A​ (97L97), high levels of ​ anthocyanin​ (resulting in ​
        blue tomatoes​ ), and two to four times the normal amount of
        lycopene (numerous available cultivars with the high crimson gene).

        Lycopene ​ has also been shown to protect against oxidative damage
        in many epidemiological and experimental studies. In addition to its
        antioxidant activity, other metabolic effects of lycopene have also
        been demonstrated. The richest source of lycopene in the diet is
        tomato and tomato derived products. ​ [40] ​ Tomato consumption has
        been associated with decreased risk of breast cancer, [ ​ 41] ​ head
        and neck cancers ​ [42] ​ and might be strongly protective against
        neurodegenerative diseases. ​ [43] ​ [44] ​ [45] ​ Tomatoes, tomato
        sauces and puree are said to help ​ lower urinary tract symptoms ​ (
        B PH ) ​ and may have anticancer properties. ​ [46] ​ Tomato
        consumption might be beneficial for reducing cardiovascular risk

        Tomatoes keep best unwashed at room temperature and out of direct
        sunlight. It is not recommended to refrigerate as this can harm the

        paper bag till ripening. ​ [49] ​ Storing stem down can prolong
