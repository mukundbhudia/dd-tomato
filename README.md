## Assumptions made
* That it's ok to do a minor upgrade to React versions (v16.5.2 -> v16.8.0 so that hooks can be used).
* That it's ok to use additional packages that weren't in the initial code (e.g. bootstrap).
* There might be more veggies/fruits/varieties so an object of such data is persisted as `/src/data/veggies.js`.
